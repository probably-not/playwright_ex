# PlaywrightEx

Elixir client for the Playwright node.js server.

Automate browsers like Chromium, Firefox, Safari and Edge.
Helpful for web scraping and agentic AI.

Please [get in touch](https://ftes.de) with feedback of any shape and size.

Enjoy!

Freddy.

## Getting started
1. Add dependency
        # mix.exs
        {:playwright_ex, "~> 0.4"}

2. Ensure `playwright` is installed (executable in `$PATH` or installed via `npm`)

3. Start connection (or add to supervision tree)
        # if installed via npm or similar add `executable: "assets/node_modules/playwright/cli.js"`
        {:ok, _} = PlaywrightEx.Supervisor.start_link(timeout: 1000)

4. Use it
        alias PlaywrightEx.{Browser, BrowserContext, Frame}

        {:ok, browser} = PlaywrightEx.launch_browser(:chromium, timeout: 1000)
        {:ok, context} = Browser.new_context(browser.guid, timeout: 1000)

        {:ok, %{main_frame: frame}} = BrowserContext.new_page(context.guid, timeout: 1000)
        {:ok, _} = Frame.goto(frame.guid, "https://elixir-lang.org/", timeout: 1000)
        {:ok, _} = Frame.click(frame.guid, Selector.link("Install"), timeout: 1000)

## Remove server via Websocket
By default, PlaywrightEx launches a local playwright driver.
This is typically installed via `npm` or `bun`.

Alternatively, PlaywrightEx can connect to a remote playwright server:

      # mix.exs
      {:websockex, "~> 0.4"}

  ```
  docker run -p 3000:3000 --rm --init -it \\
    mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.58.0-noble \\
    npx -y playwright@1.58.0 run-server --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0
  ```

      {:ok, _} = PlaywrightEx.Supervisor.start_link(
        timeout: 1000,
        ws_endpoint: "ws://localhost:3000?browser=chromium"
      )

## API Layers
Most channel functions are thin protocol wrappers.
In ExDoc, composed helpers are grouped under `Client-Composed Functions`.

## Comparison to playwright-elixir
`playwright-elixir` built on the python client and tried to provide a comprehensive client from the start.
`playwright_ex` instead is a ground-up implementation. It is not intended to be comprehensive. Rather, it is intended to be simple and easy to extend.

## Contributing

To run the tests locally, you'll need to:

1. Check out the repo
2. Run `mix setup`. This will take care of setting up your dependencies, installing the JavaScript dependencies (including Playwright), and compiling the assets.
3. Run `mix test` or, for a more thorough check that matches what we test in CI, run `mix check`.
4. Run `mix test.websocket` to run all tests against a 'remote' playwright server via websocket. Docker needs to be installed. A container is started via `testcontainers`.
